# Contributing to Feeds to Pocket

Any significant code contributions that you submit
must be made available
under the terms of the [project's license][license].
By submitting a pull request,
I assume that you agree to license your code
in accordance with the project's license terms,
without any additional terms or conditions.

If you would like to contribute a new feature,
please [file an issue][new-issue] to discuss the feature
(unless there's already an issue for that feature).
I will consider if the feature makes sense for the application,
and I may reject the feature.
By filing an issue first,
you can avoid wasting time
on a feature that I end up rejecting.

If you would like to submit changes
that fix a bug or implement an accepted feature,
please [submit a pull request][create-pull-request].
